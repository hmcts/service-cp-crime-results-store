# This is the local equivalent of the "Container smoke" step in
# .github/workflows/ci-build-publish.yml; both run this same script, so the two cannot drift.

# It proves the packaged artefact starts and answers, which no JUnit suite can: the *IT suites run
# inside the build's JVM and would still pass if the image were unbuildable.
